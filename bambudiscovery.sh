# Send the IP address of your BambuLab printer to port 2021/udp, which BambuStudio is listens on.

# Ensure your PC has firewall pot 2021/udp open. This is required as the proper response would usually go to the ephemeral source port that the M-SEARCH ssdp:discover message.
# But we are are blindly sending a response directly to the BambuStudio listening service port (2021/udp).
