# Unofficial Bambu Studio Tools
This is an unofficial repository of scripts and tools for personal use with Bambu Studio.

## Additions for portability and flexibility with moving settings out of the script and to the named config file

* Removed config.env from .gitignore
* Removed configuration variables from bambudiscovery.sh
* Added support for macOS
* Added support for OrcaSlicer in addition to BambuStudio
* Rewrote some of the code to ease readability
